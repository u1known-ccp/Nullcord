Kittycord is a community project and welcomes any kind of contribution from anyone!

Development guidelines for new contributors live in this repository — see [.rules](./.rules) for the coding standards and plugin conventions.

## How to contribute

Contributions are submitted through pull requests. If you are new to Git or GitHub, we recommend reading [this guide](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github).

Pull requests can be made to the `main` branch.

Before working on a major change, we highly recommend opening an [issue](https://github.com/CenturyRV/Kittycord/issues) for it first, so it can be discussed before you invest time. This saves you a lot of time in case your feature is considered too niche or rejected for any other reason.

## Writing a Plugin

Developing a plugin is the primary way to contribute. Kittycord's own plugins live in `src/kittycordplugins/`.

Before starting your plugin:

- Consider if this plugin would be useful to a large portion of the userbase. We do not accept niche plugins.
- Check existing pull requests and [issues](https://github.com/CenturyRV/Kittycord/issues) to see if someone is already working on a similar plugin, or if your idea was already requested or rejected.
- If no request exists, open one and clearly state that you want to work on it yourself.
- Wait for feedback before starting development, as some ideas may not be accepted or may need adjustments.
- Familiarise yourself with the plugin rules below to ensure your plugin is not rejected.

> [!WARNING]
> Skipping these steps may result in your plugin being rejected, even if it is technically correct.

## Plugin Rules

To keep Kittycord stable, secure and maintainable, all plugins must follow these rules:

1. No simple slash-command plugins (e.g. `/cat`). If applicable, create a [user-installable Discord app](https://discord.com/developers/docs/change-log#userinstallable-apps-preview) instead.
2. No simple text replacement plugins (the built-in TextReplace plugin already covers this).
3. No raw DOM manipulation — always use proper patches and React.
4. No FakeDeafen or FakeMute functionality.
5. No StereoMic-related plugins.
6. No plugins that only hide or redesign UI elements (use CSS for that). This rule may be negotiable.
7. No plugins that interact with specific third-party Discord bots (official Discord apps are allowed).
8. No selfbots or API abuse (auto-replies, animated statuses, message pruning, Nitro snipers, etc.).
9. No untrusted third-party APIs (well-known services like Google or GitHub are acceptable).
10. No plugins that require users to provide their own API keys.
11. Do not introduce new dependencies unless they are strictly necessary and well justified.

**Plugins that violate any of these rules will not be accepted.**

## Improving Kittycord Itself

If you want to improve Kittycord beyond plugins, such as internal features or performance improvements, you are welcome to open an [issue](https://github.com/CenturyRV/Kittycord/issues) so it can be discussed.

Bug fixes, refactors, and documentation improvements are also highly appreciated!

## Helping the Community

Helping out other users in the repository's [issues](https://github.com/CenturyRV/Kittycord/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/CenturyRV/Kittycord/discussions) is always appreciated! The more, the merrier.
